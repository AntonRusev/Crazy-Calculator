## 1. Caclulator with a twist...

Crazy Calculator is just like any regular calculator, except that it acts... crazy. The buttons tend to shuffle whenever you press one of them, making it harder(and much more annoying!) to complete the desired calculation. 

## 2. Why would anyone want to use it? 

In order to not make this app feel like a complete waste of code, there is a game connected to the calculator, called Crazy Calculating Challenge. 

## 3. What is the Crazy Calculating Challenge?

Once you click the "START" button that is located to the left of the calculator itself, a random three-digit number will be generated and a timer will start. Your goal is as quickly as possible to get that number as result on the display of the calculator, while performing a minimum of three algorithmic operations(using one, or a mix of "+", "-", "/" or "x").

## 4. High-scores

On the right side of the calculator is located the high-scores of the current session list. The best times will be displayed there, from best to worst, in descending order.
